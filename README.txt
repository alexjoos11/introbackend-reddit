Name: Alexander Joos
NetID: aaj46

Challenges Attempted: (Tier I, Tier II, Tier III)

Difficulties: See comment #3, I had to delete the collection and manually make instead
Comments:
 - Is there priority for errors?
 - When returning, should I return a copy or the actual value?
 - What should the return be if there are no comments 404 or {}?
 - In postman when I duplicated some of my requests to make new ones it messed up the run order
